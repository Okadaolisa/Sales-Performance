# Result

Regional Sales: The West region contributed the most sales (60%, $107.48K), followed by the East (23%, $41.71K), South (10%, $17.31K), and Central (8%, $14.01K).
Yearly Trends: Sales peaked in 2017 at $70K but declined significantly in 2018, requiring further investigation.
Top Cities: Los Angeles and Seattle were the leading cities in sales, while Montana and New Mexico underperformed within the West region.
Segment Performance: The Consumer segment dominated sales, with the Corporate and Home Office segments showing potential for growth.
Shipping Modes: Standard Class was the most utilized shipping method, with limited adoption of Same Day delivery.

# Summary

The analysis highlights strong performance in the West region, consistent year-on-year growth until 2017, and the dominance of the Consumer segment. However, underperforming regions, declining sales in 2018, and underutilization of certain shipping modes point to areas for improvement.
To address these issues, it is recommended to investigate the factors contributing to the 2018 sales decline and develop strategies to recover lost revenue. Efforts should also focus on expanding underperforming regions, particularly the Central and South regions, and states like Montana and New Mexico. Diversifying efforts across segments by enhancing marketing for the Corporate and Home Office sectors could balance revenue streams.
Additionally, promoting Same Day delivery as a shipping option can enhance customer satisfaction and attract high-value orders. Leveraging strategies from high-performing cities and regions, as well as recognizing and replicating the techniques of top-performing sales personnel, can drive growth and uplift overall team performance.
