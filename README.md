# Result

Regional Sales: The West region contributed the most sales (60%, $107.48K), followed by the East (23%, $41.71K), South (10%, $17.31K), and Central (8%, $14.01K).
Yearly Trends: Sales peaked in 2017 at $70K but declined significantly in 2018, requiring further investigation.
Top Cities: Los Angeles and Seattle were the leading cities in sales, while Montana and New Mexico underperformed within the West region.
Segment Performance: The Consumer segment dominated sales, with the Corporate and Home Office segments showing potential for growth.
Shipping Modes: Standard Class was the most utilized shipping method, with limited adoption of Same Day delivery.

# Summary

The analysis highlights a strong performance in the West region, consistent year-on-year growth until 2017, and the dominance of the Consumer segment. 
However, underperforming regions and declining sales in 2018 indicate opportunities for improvement. Shipping modes also suggest untapped potential in Same Day delivery.

# Recommendations

Expand Underperforming Regions: Focus on increasing sales in the Central and South regions and states like Montana and New Mexico.
Diversify Segment Efforts: Enhance marketing and sales efforts for the Corporate and Home Office segments to balance revenue streams.
Promote Same Day Delivery: Encourage adoption of Same Day shipping to improve customer satisfaction and attract high-value orders.
Leverage Success Strategies: Replicate strategies from high-performing cities and regions to boost growth in underperforming areas.
Recognize High Performers: Use the techniques of top-performing sales personnel to mentor and uplift team performance.
